# Project-2---Book-Library-Management-System
This project is about creating a console-based application in C++ to manage a small book library. Structures and arrays were used to store book information and allow users to:

- Add new books

- Search for books by title or author

- Display all books

- Borrow and return books

The program includes a menu for users to choose actions and ensures input is valid (like checking for duplicate ISBNs).
